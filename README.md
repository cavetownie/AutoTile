# AutoTile

A small weekend project I made to try and automate the playing of a piano-tile style game.<br>
Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHRubMACen0

# Usage
Install the project and extract. Afterwards open the game of choice. Now run the `main.py` script located in `autotile/`.
Now everything should be set and you'll be hitting new highscores!:) Depending on the game, it might be useful to change
the images in `images/`.
